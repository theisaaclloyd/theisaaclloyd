I am a cyber operations and computer science student building secure technology that solves real problems. At Cedarville University, I've developed technical skills through cybersecurity coursework and competitions, recently ranking in the 99th percentile among 8,500+ participants in the National Cyber League. My time spent as a Software Developer with the Creative Solutions Group taught me to apply these skills in team-based projects. This past school year we designed, built, and released a full-stack Next.js application, a collaborative event planning/mapping tool that will significantly improve the Campus Experience team’s effectiveness in designing event plans.

I have found that great work happens when talented people commit to excellence together. This idea has guided my work in everything that I do, from national cybersecurity competitions or large collaborative full-stack development projects to spending time with the people I care about or investing time into learning. I have been blessed to work alongside many talented people, and being able to share my motivation with them has led to some really amazing accomplishments, such as my team’s placement in the 2024 Hivestorm competition (32nd out of 446 teams). 

Some specific skills I would like to highlight:
 - Offensive Security: OSINT, web application exploitation, and vulnerability assessment
 - Security Implementations: Authentication systems and secure API design
 - Full Stack Development: React/Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js/Express
 - DevOps: Docker, Docker Compose, CI/CD workflows, GitHub automation, deployment strategies

I believe that high-quality technology needs both architects who understand systems and collaborators who connect with people. I aim to be both.
