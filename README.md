Hey, I'm Isaac. I am a freshman student at Cedarville University majoring in computer science and cyber operations. I've been fascinated by computers since I was 9 and I am blessed to be learning so much more about how they work through my education here at Cedarville.

I am passionate about creative problem solving with software and hardware and I love spending my pastime creating random projects to do random things (every now and then I'll make something useful...).

I'll be publishing more projects here as I come up with them.

-Isaac
