Hey, I'm Isaac. I'm a sophomore computer science student, and in my free time I write code. As a student, my free time is rare, but at least in my not-free time I also write code.

I post most of my "fun" projects here publicly, so if you want to see what I’ve been working on, check out my profile.

Feel free to email me with any questions, comments, or concerns (except for comments on my commit messages—I usually lack creativity past 3 AM).

Jokes aside, I've loved computers and software since I was 9, and I feel blessed to be learning so much more through my education. I am passionate about creative problem-solving with software and hardware, and I love spending my pastime creating random projects to do cool things (every now and then I even make something useful...).

—Isaac
